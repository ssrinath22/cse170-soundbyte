# INSTALL DEPENDECIES
The only depenencies you'll need are `node.js`, and `git`.
Below I have linked some resources to help you install these dependencies.

Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/
Git: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git

# RUN THE APP
You can now run the app with the command (inside the project directory):
`npm start`
